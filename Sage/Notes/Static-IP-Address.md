# <kbd> Static IP-Address </kbd>
## About
It is an IP Address that does change (unlike Dynamic IP)
Usually used to maintain a permanent endpoint, for servers.
It is less secure than Dynamic IP, and might need a separate setup for security.[^1]

## Advantage of Static IP
1. Easier to setup and manage DNS servers
2. Faster for traffic to reach, especially when hosting file-server / email-server
3. Remote Access and VPN setup is easier
4. Easier for Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services to make calls / video calls
5. Matches IP address with geo-location, hence location based services are more accurate.
## Disadvantages of Static IP

1. Since it is possible to locate your server, it is prone to hacking easily
2. Physical location of server, user is exposed.
3. Higher cost / ISP charges.

## Usage

Static IP is better suited for large companies who;
1. host their own web servers / sites
2. have a team of network administrators who can setup, manage, secure, and maintain servers
3. have a separate workplace, to ensure physical location of home is protected
