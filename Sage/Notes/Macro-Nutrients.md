## About

*Macronutrients(macros) are the nutrients that your body need in large amounts.*[^1]

Macronutrients are required by the human body to maintain system. Some provide energy directly to the body, and some do not. When people usually talk about macros, they refer to the energy providing classes of macro-nutrients (a.k.a. *principal classes*[^2])

### Principal Classes
These are relatively consumed in large quantities, compared to [[Micro-Nutrients]] such as Vitamins, and Minerals.

1. [Protein](Protein-for-the-Body.md) ~16.7 KJ/g[^3]
2. Carbohydrates ~16.7KJ/g [^3]
4. Fats ~37.4 KJ/g[^3]

These are not to be confused with Calories - as they measure the nutrition value of a meal (combination of the nutrients in specific ratios, in each ingredient)[^2]

### Other Classes
These are also ingested in large quantities, but *do not provide any nutritional value.* #Citation-Needed

1. Oxygen
2. Water
3. Fiber
