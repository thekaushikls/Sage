## About
!!! quote 
	"the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without explicitly being programmed" - [Arthur Samuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Samuel_(computer_scientist))[^1]

Machine Learning (ML) is sub-field of [Artificial-Intelligence](Projects/Artificial-Intelligence.md), that deals with software algorithms for two purposes.[^2]
1. Detect and learn patterns from a dataset. (The training  / learning part)
2. Make predictions on unseen / undisclosed data without being explicitly programmed.

ML is mainly concerned with making the Machine (computer) learn - patterns from available data to make predictions (guess-timations). How accurate these predictions are, depends highly on the quality of training data, the methodology used, and the amount of human intervention during the training / learning stage.

## Machine Learning Model

* A Machine-Learning-Model is the product of the Machine Learning process(es).
* It describes the algorithm / system that has been trained on data, to recognize patterns and/or make predictions.

## Supervised Learning

## Un-Supervised Learning
