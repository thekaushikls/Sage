## About
Protein is one of the principal [Macro-Nutrients](Notes/Macro-Nutrients.md) required for the human body. 

1. Tissue Repair[^1]
2. Fluid Balance
3. Regulate Sugar (Insulin)
4. Muscle Repair

### ✅ Recommended

The amount of protein required by a person can be calculated by their body weight, and the amount of exercise they get. For a sedentary person;

> *0.8g/Kg (0.36g/lb.) is the recommended amount of protein per day.*[^2]

Which means, if I weight 80Kg, I require 64g of protein everyday, or roughly 2Kg per month[^3]

| Profile | Requirement (g/Kg)[^1] |
| :--- | :----: |
| Sedentary | 0.8 |
| Over 40 years | 1 - 1.2 |
| Active | 1.1 - 1.5 |
| Athletic | 1.2 - 1.7 |

### ❌ Excess

The human body cannot store protein, so it is converted and stored as fat.[^5] So excess protein does not compensate for strength training when trying to increase muscle size.

### ⭕ Deficiency
