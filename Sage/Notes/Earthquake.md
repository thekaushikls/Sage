## About
An earthquake is a [Natural Hazard](Hazards.md#natural-hazards) (disaster) caused by sudden release of strain energy between the tectonic plates on the earth's crust[^1] causing tremors, vibrations, landslides, etc.

!!! tip 
	The scientific study of earthquakes, and the propagation of seismic waves within the Earth is called Seismology.

The origin of the movement is called the `Focus` or `Hypocenter` of the earthquake. The vibrations travel outward, causing (wave-like) disturbance across all directions from the epicenter causing damage to lives, ecosystems, properties, 

!!! question "How is Hypocenter different from Epicenter?"

	 **Hypocenter** is the point at which the earthquake originates, in 3D space. The vibrations travel in all 3 dimensions (6 directions).
	
	**Epicenter** is the hypocenter when projected onto the surface of the planet for mapping purposes. The impact is not measured in the depth dimension, rather the XY-Plane of the (Mercator)projection.

As one moves away from the Hypocenter, the (seismic)wave is dampened, and hence the intensity of damage is also reduced.

## Impacts
An earthquake is a dangerous natural hazard / disaster, and can cause a multitude of damage to [Structures](Earthquake-Impact-on-Structures.md), Environment, and the Economy.

1. Environmental Impacts
	1. Soil Liquefaction
2. Structural Impacts
	1. Sway
	2. Deformation
	3. Twisting
	4. Brittle failure (Load Bearing Structures)
	5. Ductile Failure (RCC Structures)
