## About

**Computation** (to compute) means to perform a (mathematical) calculation - usually using computers. *(example: Addition is a basic example of computation)*

**Design** refers to a process and/or it's intentional output, or a system that has been arranged to eventually create something. *(example: Industrial Design refers to the framework that helps create consumer products.)*

To combine both **Computation** and **Design** could mean 


>	Imagine you have to calculate the average percentile of a class. You feed in the values, and operators to a calculator, get the result, and go about your day.
>	You do not care about "how" a calculator works, the electronic parts, the software, etc. You only care whether it works properly, and about the result of your calculation.
>	
>	This is how A + B is. You do not care about "how" something works. 


### A + B: Compute(Design)

>	The result of calculation is some "design" - a framework to create "designed objects"
>	The compute function takes in inputs or "parameters" that form the properties of the end product - designed object(s).
>	
>	A computational designer's job would be to create the calculation framework, that helps create the design framework. A potential user will probably use the design framework to create design objects (products)

The calculation here could refer to "the design" 

### B + A: Design(Computation)

>	Here, design is the driving force. A design process (with intentional output) dictates




Any compute function has three parts.
1. Input
2. Operation
3. Output

For example; in the case of addition,
1. Input => two numbers
2. Operation => add()
3. Output => sum of two numbers
