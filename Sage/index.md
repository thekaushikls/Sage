>	I published my first <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/RhinoCommon.Extensions.Dotbim/1.0.0" target="_blank">nuget package &#x1F865;</a>. This is something I have been yearning to do for a long time - hindered by self rejecting my ideas. Today, I finally did it. The process, and even the feeling afterward is very similar to publishing on PyPI, Yak, Food4Rhino, etc. - quite Meh.<br><br>Now that this thirst has been quenched, I am one step closer to catching up with "The Ideas".
