>	I was too busy researching about food - what to eat, and how to eat it. I forgot to cook any. Ironic.

    <br>I think with the [CoDe Collective](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/14452006/) community, it is better to go together even if things take their time. Going together will help other collaborators take ownership of the community. If I want to go fast, I should work on my CAADRIA2025 research paper.

>	I published my first <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/RhinoCommon.Extensions.Dotbim/1.0.0" target="_blank">nuget package &#x1F865;</a>. This is something I have been yearning to do for a long time - hindered by self rejecting my ideas. Today, I finally did it. The process, and even the feeling afterward is very similar to publishing on PyPI, Yak, Food4Rhino, etc. - quite Meh.<br><br>Now that this thirst has been quenched, I am one step closer to catching up with "The Ideas".
