One of the aims of an SDA team is to identify recurring scenarios, generalize problems, and establish standard approaches, allowing newer innovations to further development.</p> <p>A common challenge in SDA is choosing between top-down and bottom-up approaches to processing information. Often, Parametric Design (PD) and Generative Design (GD) approaches operate via the top-down approach, while Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Assembly Modeling (ASM) opt for the bottom-up approach. But, in a practical setting, BIM and ASM models often require propagating changes from the top, and PD and GD models require detailed information at the bottom. This necessitates a unified approach, allowing dynamic control from either direction at any given time.</p> <p>Both approaches focus on the geometric elements or nodes. By shifting the focus towards the relationship (edge) between nodes, we may develop a framework to organize, store, query, and operate on a unified data structure, where information may be represented by a graph data structure.</p> <p>To investigate the viability, and practical application(s) of such frameworks, this paper reviews existing publications on the topic and implements a proof-of-concept workflow to test various real-world use cases, report the findings, and propose further development trajectories.</p> <p>Keywords: Computational Design, Systems Design, Graph Theory, Applied Research, Design Methodology</p>","tags":["Computational-Design","Systems-Design","Graph-Theory","Applied-Research","Automation"]},{"location":"Projects/CAADRIA-2025/Abstract/#see-also","title":"See Also","text":"<ol> <li>Call for Papers</li> </ol>","tags":["Computational-Design","Systems-Design","Graph-Theory","Applied-Research","Automation"]},{"location":"Projects/CAADRIA-2025/Abstract/#references","title":"References","text":"<ol> <li>Asghari, M., Sadat, M.
